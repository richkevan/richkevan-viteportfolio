    Hello there! My name is Richard Kevan, and I'm a 39-year-old software engineer. I have a passion for all things technology and have been working in the field of software engineering for the past 3 years.

    I have a unique combination of skills and experience that allows me to think outside the box when it comes to creating innovative solutions. I specialize in developing software applications for web and mobile platforms, but I also have experience in streaming, video production and identity management.

    When I'm not working, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. I'm an avid video game enthusiast, so you can often find me playing video games. I also have a passion for 3D printing, video editing, and electronic engineering. In my free time, I like to explore ghost towns and learn about their history. 

    If you're looking for an experienced software engineer who is passionate about technology, I'm your guy! Feel free to contact me if you'd like to learn more about my skills and experience.
